# Netflix Project

## Project description:
The project analyzes Netflix data (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)) and creates an interactive website with visualizations and movie recommendations.

## Project objectives:

- Data exploration and cleaning (dates, gaps, genres, countries).
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with attractive graphics:
  - distribution of films and TV series
  - top genres
  - dynamics by year
  - distribution by country
- Creating a content-based recommender (TF-IDF) to search for similar films.
- An interactive mini-site via Streamlit, where you can enter a film title and receive recommendations.

## Technologies and libraries:
- Python: pandas, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine learning: scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
- Web interface: Streamlit

## How to launch the project:
